# Building-your-own-AI-Nutrition-Coach-using-a-Multi-Agent-System-and-Multimodal-AI
Build and deploy a multi-agent system that powers intelligent decision-making.  Integrate multimodal AI to handle both visual and textual data.  Create a user-friendly interface using Gradio, so your app is accessible to anyone.
Welcome, learners! Have you ever wondered how AI could become your personal health companion, guiding you to make smarter food choices effortlessly? Imagine an app that not only identifies what's on your plate, but also gives you insightful nutritional details and actionable tips—all powered by state-of-the-art AI. In the previous project, we built the foundation for such a tool: NourishBot, an AI-driven nutrition assistant that leverages Meta's advanced multimodal model, Llama 3.2 90B Vision Instruct, alongside Flask.

But what if we could do more? What if NourishBot could evolve beyond just recognizing food to offering dynamic, real-time advice based on various factors—like dietary preferences—as well as suggesting recipes based on what you have in your fridge? That's exactly what we're doing in this project. We're stepping into the world of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)—a framework where multiple AI agents collaborate to make complex decisions and offer tailored guidance.

Think of it this way: one agent processes the visual input (your meal), another analyzes the nutritional content, and a third could provide meal suggestions based on your dietary preference. By working together, these agents can deliver a personalized, seamless user experience that feels less like a static app and more like an intelligent partner in your wellness journey.

To make it even better, we'll use Gradio, a simple yet powerful framework for creating interactive web apps. This means you'll walk away not just understanding advanced AI concepts, but also with a fully functional, sleek app that anyone can use.

In this 60-minute hands-on journey, you'll learn how to:

Build and deploy a multi-agent system that powers intelligent decision-making.
Integrate multimodal AI to handle both visual and textual data.
Create a user-friendly interface using Gradio, so your app is accessible to anyone.
By the end, you'll have more than just a project—you'll have a powerful tool that could inspire future innovations in health tech, personalized AI assistants, or even smart kitchen devices.

If you're curious about how cutting-edge AI frameworks can be combined to solve real-world problems and want to gain hands-on experience with Generative AI, MAS, and multimodality, this is the perfect project for you!
